Take a look at this great interactive sketch that Nicky Case made. You have two candidates {{ A }} {{ B }} and you have a voter <img src="play/img/voter.png" /> . Just move the voter and you'll see that he is just gonna vote for whoever he's closest to.

{% include sim-intro.html id='model1' caption='`<b><span style="font-size:2.5em;">click &amp; drag</span><br>the candidates and the voter:</b>`' %}

You can add more voters and see that you kinda get a sense of how voters are gonna vote as they move around and how an election with those voters would go. Most votes wins.

{% include sim-intro.html id='model2' caption='`<b>drag the candidates &amp; voter<span class="underline">s</span> around.<br>(to move voters, drag the <em>middle</em> of the crowd)<br>watch how that changes the election:</b>`' %}

In this kind of voting, you get a single choice for who you want to win. The ballot is pretty simple. This is the way the ballot is now.

Why do we vote this way? Why do we even vote? In the next part, I'm going to explain voting as a way to find common ground as a group.
