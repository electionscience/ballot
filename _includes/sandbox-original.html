					One hope for Sandbox Mode is that readers can debate with me and each other <em>using</em> this tool!
					Not just telling me I'm wrong, but <em>showing</em> me I'm wrong.
					For example –

						here's a model I made in Sandbox Mode,
						showing an interesting argument <em>against</em> Approval &amp; Score Voting</a>.
					Granted, this tool is very limited – it doesn't handle strategic voting or imperfect information –
					but I think it's a start, and may help improve our Democratic Discourse&trade;
