Here's some great resources for expanding your voting knowledge.  Some were referenced in the pages on this site.

**Simulators**

* [Voteline](http://zesty.ca/voting/voteline/) - by Ka-Ping Yee - uses Flash.
* [Political Sim](https://www.accuratedemocracy.com/s_sim.htm) - by [Accurate Democracy](https://www.accuratedemocracy.com/) - the earliest interactive voting simulator.  It requires some technical know-how to get going.
* [To Build a Better Ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot) - by Nicky Case - The original sim this sim is based on.
* [Median Voter](https://pianop.ly/voting/median) - a simple conceptual experiment with discussion of strategy and median and mean.

**Calculators**

* [RBVote Calculator](http://www.cs.angelo.edu/~rlegrand/rbvote/calc.html) - I copied all of his methods into this simulator under "RBVote"

**Videos**

- [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo&index=1&list=PLkLBH5Kzphe0Qu8mCW1Leef2xSxPK1FIe) - This set of videos are excellent intro to voting methods, ready to share. He made them at the time that the UK was considering using IRV, which the UK called the Alternative Vote for historical reasons. 
- [Tactical Voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE-ktIxN-6Q) - A good overview of what strategy means in voting.
