# Finding Common Ground

Hello I'm going to show you how to find common ground as a group.   We'll go over the following:

* what we mean by the middle, 

* how we can use votes to find the middle by simple comparisons, 

* the simplest voting method that finds the middle, and

* the world of voting methods.

Let's jump right in with an example and some diagrams.

## The Middle

Now in a group you may have to come to a decision. and it's going to be a lot of different people in this group. So each one is going to have a different opinion and they're going to be spaced out in different dimensions of how they feel about a topic.. Maybe What pizza to get as a group order for pizza,  or where you going to go out to eat, or something like that.   So some people would be vegetarian or like meat.   And some people like to spend a lot of money and some a little money. so whatever Dimensions there are, you're going to have differing opinions on dining or whatever.

Really, this is about politics.  And as a group you want to make a decision so that people would say they don't regret making that decision. When will you find out does it stay regret this decision is this most people would rather do something else. so that's why you might want to take something in the middle. no matter what you pick in the middle, if you compared to something else, more people are going to prefer that pedal option. it's really the common ground that you're looking for.

So how do you find the middle option?  Well, we could hold a vote.   And you have all the options in this vote.  And what happens is that you divide people up into these little groups and you'll find out that people will pick a side.  It's common sense.  If you only say pick one, then they pick their side and they vote for it.  And it's kind of random which side wins.  And that's a win with maybe with less than 25% of people… so what's going on here… well, people split into little groups, and that's the problem.

## Simple Comparisons

So how do you solve that problem? So instead of dividing everybody up all at once, just consider each alternative one at a time (I guess that's two at a time).  So just between the two options below, you can tell which one's better.

{% include sim.html link='[link](https://paretoman.github.io/ballot/sandbox/?v=2.5&m=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3VSu27DMAz8FUOzB1Ev2x09dCuQJkEWO4NaGIlbNS6cZAiK9ttL8ZB2CAIBIukjT0fSX0qrh64ja0sKdlt2fJe12W5LRQI4BpzOsVUPulRObi934AxT3hzOrRjR5c1hpL6LNHcRYo3EJivKoZHXCYIIigiSKMCwAHJs-TnDphECwzz80ZB8NAYGNMYhhWksG9CYClGNqJECq0Uo5ZGQANZIrbXAIcgyU0dICwDAZpu_eidU2aGrY66OzcPNjpMq90_ngjznKiwE4hxa9Br7YT7106vldImpWMa3vj-053k3zEUb5wNHT0M8Fat9fH3nYDPsduNQbMaUIoeLefyYirZ9Zn-9H4rH6TwXqyEep8OxV4rpMTqPhj1G5z0MRuehztei3mN0QcOQZAbsMWABwctY-B9UARQBnYVGTIXOKtRWGPlLTGk6rS-fA_e7SOc5pvF0Ud-_SCNeB9cCAAA)' title='Count By Pairs'

caption='Consider the alternatives one at a time.  It's simpler, and you can always tell which option is closer to the middle.' 

comment='two candidates with a circle.' id='by_pairs_sim' %}

And you can do this for all the options.  And you can see that the middle option would beat any other option.  This is called a round robin.  Ping pong tournaments work like this.

{% include sim.html link='[link](https://paretoman.github.io/ballot/sandbox/?v=2.5&m=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3VSPW_CQAz9K9HNN8T3mTAydKvUAmJJGK5tBJQ0qQIMqGp_e31-ZSlCJ-XZZ_ud_ZwvVapZ05C1moLd6Ia_ujJsGMNX0eUrG7Whmq3gNTnabLQiqXKc4srsWzUrtXJqVmvlxQ6cYfTN4dzIkVLfHI5UdyP13QjxAMSQO8qukdcJDZEDoCUKAG6AHCM_5xlqITDMw5eGeQyDAYDGOKQwjWUAjYnwKni1FNhSGqUsCUnAGqm1FnE0ZJmpIf13cnJAGJwW4xILZjWvQDmhzQZdDXM1bBY6G05q3X9qF6QBF7EitOswtC_F88yqflq1GC-pLxbpvW2H-XnadlMxT9PA3mOXTsVyl14P7Ky77XbfFet93yd2n6b9x1jM589sr3Zd8TCep2LZpeM4HFulmB5iekjgIab3AIjp0Z2vZAYPMUMJIMkM2GzASoIXifiXVQEUAZOFWiBisojaiCW8pL4fT6vLZ8fzLtJw6N7U9y_No278AwMAAA)' title='Count By Pairs for Everyone' 

caption='Matching up all the pairs is called a round robin.' 

comment='two candidates with a circle.' id='by_pairs2_sim' %}

So what would that look like? (for voting). That would basically be looking at every possible pair of options.  So say there's options A B C D E, and you like them in that order.  That means you like A over B, and A over C, and B over C, and so on. You have a choice for every pair.  Really, you have a single ranking.  So say you had a ballot.  You had ABCDE on the ballot. Then on the ballot, you'd write 12345 on the ballot because you like \#1 A, then \#2 B, and so on.  So you'd put these guys into a tier system, a ranking system.  And in your ranking system you can tell for A versus E, you like A better. And everybody can do that.  And it'll work pretty well to find out where the middle is.  So that ranking system is pretty good.

## The Simplest Ballot

So what else is there?  You can also just allow people to vote for more than just one candidate.  This will be really easy to explain with a common kind of diagram, a Venn diagram.

comment='too simple?' id='approval2_sim' %}

So say there's two populations of people and they like candidates in their little circle. If you allow them to vote for everybody in their circle, then the people in the middle get more votes than the people on either side.

Here's another example for a small group.  A on the left gets half the vote.  C on the right gets half the vote.  B in the middle gets all the vote.  B is the common ground.

<!--This solved a big problem.  Usually, the way we do things is to only allow one choice.  If you only allow these voters to vote for one person, then they're going to vote for the person in the center of their circle. You can imagine this like a primary. So each group has their own primary.  And each one picks their own candidate, and they run against each other in the general And nobody is running in the middle.   Why? Because people are only going to vote for their own nominees. And even if they do vote for the middle guy,  it's going to be a small amount of people. the rest of the people are closer to one or the other Party candidate.-->

So what does that actually look like at the ballot? Well, it's pretty simple. You have A B C D E and you have a checkbox next to each one. If you like A and B, check both boxes.  If you like D and E, check those.  If you like every candidate but A, then there you go.  This is approval voting, where you vote for those you approve of.

## The World of Voting Methods

There's also other voting methods where you can judge on a scale from 1 to 10 like you do for a diving contest or something.  And you can get very fine-grained with that. That's called score voting, where you get them a score.   

{% include sim.html link='[link](https://paretoman.github.io/ballot/sandbox/?v=2.5&m=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3VRQU4DMQz8i885xI6dbPfMD-ht1QO0i6hUdau2CCEEb8fOlAuoymHs2J7MOJ-UaZymVhNr26SJeUg81IjMI5WIhna7E_GotM0mEccYZ8-zRl5ozImURuZE5pCoektO_443t7uV4W5ldbfCub_NISlSQQpFrAAD1K6MXQCroz9nDqteFOfxS-HeIwIAjSgypykOFZcN2YDMWcQXkbtQjp2AqYCpgKmAqTjTxOl2orliHJwFdjlJKkm9rEEbfRo2w7bKb-DEU4lA-6z-pVa41oY_glxd9UvD8owBkGqQatid4TsNpq11nTb0twymawbAcMUPVLBU61ZCYAVFhYKKtTcoaJht0pmenw6H5br-OM000uN2Oc-U6PK6vD_Ml-15f7rul6NXvt-Ou_llf5x39PUDc7xiOMsCAAA)' title='Score Voting'

Another great voting method combines score voting with counting by pairs.  This is called STAR voting, Score Then Automatic Runoff.  The runoff uses the counts by pairs.

You could involve some conditionals. Like you could eliminate candidates that aren't doing well. That way they don't interfere with the main candidates.  This method is called RCV and is getting more popular in the US \<-- link to rcv --\>.

And you can also have a multi-winner system where maybe you have two candidates getting elected \<-- link to multiwinner --\>.  For example, maybe you're picking a pizza and you can have meat lovers pizza and you can also have a vegetarian pizza. You don't have to all eat the same pizza.

## End

To wrap things up, there's a lot of ways you could deal with voting (casting a ballot), and there's actually even more ways you can count ballots (tallying).  As far as casting a ballot goes, picking one person does not find common ground in a group.  But picking multiple people… that allows you to find common ground.  And that's the point of this explanation. You have to allow people to vote for more than one person in order to find common ground.

Still want more, try the sandbox below, where I've added a ton more voting methods and configuration options.  

Want more of a narrative?  Then choose your path.  Either read about Primaries, more details about approval voting and strategy, or an essay by Jameson Quinn on strategy and STAR voting.  Soon, I'll have an essay about RCV, IRV, STV, and multi-winner methods.  It's a work in progress.
