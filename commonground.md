Hello, I'm going to show you how to find common ground as a group.   We'll go over the following:

* what we mean by the middle, 

* how we can use votes to find the middle by simple comparisons, 

* the simplest voting method that finds the middle, and

* the world of voting methods.

Let's jump right in with an example and some diagrams.

## The Middle

Now in a group you may have to come to a decision, and there's going to be a lot of different people in this group. So each one is going to have a different opinion, and they're going to be spaced out in different dimensions of how they feel about a topic: maybe what pizza to get as a group order for pizza,  or where you are going to go out to eat, or something like that.   So some people would be vegetarian or like meat.   And some people like to spend a lot of money and some a little money.  So whatever dimensions there are, you're going to have differing opinions on dining or whatever.

Really, this is about politics, and as a group you want to make a decision for everyone in the group.  You'd like it to be so that people would say they don't regret making that decision.  One way you will find out  if people regret this decision is if most people say they would rather do something else.  So that's why you might want to pick something in the middle because no matter what you pick in the middle, if you compared to something else, then more people are going to prefer that middle option. It's really the common ground that you're looking for.

So how do you find the middle option?  Well, you could hold a vote.   And you have all the options in this vote.  And what happens is that you'll find out that people will pick a side, and you end up dividing people into these little groups.  It's common sense.  If you only say pick one, then they pick their side and they vote for it.  And it's kind of random which side wins.  And that's a win with maybe with less than 25% of people… so what's going on here… well, people split into little groups, and that's the problem.

A great simple example of this problem is the spoiler effect, which you get if you have three candidates in an election.  A small candidate can change the outcome of the race even if they don't win.  And they spoil the election for whichever side they're on.

## Simple Comparisons

So how do you solve that problem? So instead of dividing everybody up all at once, just consider each alternative one at a time (I guess that's two at a time).  So just between the two options below, you can tell which one's better.

{% include sim.html link='[link](http://127.0.0.1:4000/ballot/sandbox/?v=2.5&m=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3VRPW_CMBD9K5FnDz5_hTBm6FapBcSSMLitBZQ0qQIMqGp_ey_3RDsg5OHu_O6e3z1_KaPmTUPeavJ-oxuqnLYmbjZaERDHiJlqp-ZGK6_mlVZB8sgdVt8c7i0ZMfrmMDK7i1R3ETLyHE2KptKihCDyCJBEEYEFkOfIz1kOzE1aWebhS0tyaS0CaKxHC9M4DqCxJaoZqkoGnBGhNFlCAjgrs84BhyDHTA2hLQIAm6v-5r1QTQldE3tN3GTulHiZ8v90PspzvsSHQJzHigFWBeZTP61aDJfUFYv03rZ9fR63eSzqNPZcPeZ0Kpa79HrgYp23230u1vuuS1w-jfuPoajrZ85Xu1w8DOexWOZ0HPpjqxTTw7rgxM8A60JAgHUB6sJM1AdYFw0CSWfEP0Z8QAxii-MFIygiNouVhBKblZgtYflL6rrhtLp8Zt53kfpDflPfvwTcre3VAgAA)' 

title='Count By Pairs'

caption='Consider the alternatives one at a time.  It is simpler, and you can always tell which option is closer to the middle.' 

comment='two candidates with a circle.' id='by_pairs_sim' %}

And you can do this for all the options.  And you can see that the middle option would beat any other option.  This is called a round robin.  Ping pong tournaments work like this.

{% include sim.html link='[link](http://127.0.0.1:4000/ballot/sandbox/?v=2.5&m=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3VRPW_CQAz9K9HNN8Tn-0gYGbpVagGxJAzXNgJKmlQBBlS1v72-e2UpQjc8O7Zfnp-_VKlmTUNcabJhoxvyrCsjgTGsKdj0iYM2VEvknXTRZqMV5SkrLbZMOatZqZVVs1orl2MvHUbfPOkNUin1zZNKdbdS361QmX9HSVFKDVIIIguAJPIAEUBWUH7nBISbtDLCIx-N8BgBAwCNsWgRGhYAjQnIKmR1HuAyC6VkCeUCmzzLjDoEsTA1pP9eavYog5OxLolhrOUEymbaFNA1MNeAk9EpsHnW_qe2PguwASeCXIulHcxzwqp-WrUYL7EvFvG9bYf5edp2UzGP0yDZYxdPxXIXXw-SrLvtdt8V633fR0mfpv3HWMznzxKvdl3xMJ6nYtnF4zgcW6WEHmY6zg47mOkcAGY6qHNV3sHBTF8CKHd6XNbjJN5li1gW9KDw2MzXGQI2C5gNOMJL7PvxtLp8drLvIg6H7k19_wJC4-xxAwMAAA)' title='Count By Pairs for Everyone' 

caption='Matching up all the pairs is called a round robin. A wins all their matches. Mouse over the results to see each match.' 

comment='two candidates with a circle. Maybe I could use names for ping pong.' id='by_pairs2_sim' %}

So what would that look like? (in an actual election). That would basically be looking at every possible pair of options.  So say there's options A B C D E, and you like them in that order.  That means you like A over B, and A over C, and B over C, and so on. You have a choice for every pair.  And you could write that on a ballot.  But really, you have a single ranking, which is easier to write.  

You would get a ballot with the names A B C D E written on it. And because you like them in that order, you'd write 1 2 3 4 5 on the ballot; you like \#1 A, then \#2 B, and so on.  From your ranking you can tell, for example, that for A versus E, you like A better, and so on for every pair.

So everybody writes their rankings on the ballot, and then we count all the ballots one pair at a time.  If we find that one candidate was able to win all their matches, then we've found the middle.

## The Simplest Ballot

So what else is there?  You can also just allow people to vote for more than just one candidate.  This will be really easy to explain with a common kind of diagram, a Venn diagram.

{% include sim.html link='[link](http://127.0.0.1:4000/ballot/sandbox/?v=2.5&m=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3VSu24CMRD8lZNrF16_jqMLRbpICSAaoHCiE5BcOHRAJBQl356xp0AKQlfMrmc93p29b2XUeLmMUYt1a70UMVrqmCNf46xEowZnHpF1gjOzXmsl-Zo1qAkCpgERXCacGhutvBpDSYWSRNRaffOhuAZj9M0HZnSXae4yYspzknvLqWXKjsQT2JJEAhoQD8RzAQBt0cpCB4cWOhZgCZSxniWQcQDK2JrZiFlTLjhTGpXsiRTC2XLXOfJsyEFpCff45eJImpqO4woMcxo7UN6wPodCK3Jor6G7Fvii4f8_4WNpxNfcFdv2HD7QxABt9btS0_6Sumqa3ler_eQ8bNqhmqRhj-ypTadqtk1vH0gW7Waza6vFrusS0udh99lXk8kL4vm2rR7781DN2nTs98eVUpCnqcEVpwNNDYFAUwO7C6MyQ6Cp0RCkVEZuOHI1MRQP8BurSInIyWJToOZkNe_WXMZr6rr-NL8cWsz7cDgM_Vfq1M8fSXNUexgDAAA)' title='Venn Diagram' 

caption='The voters vote for everyone in their circle.  Both like C.' 

comment='too simple?' id='approval2_sim' %}

So what does that actually look like on a ballot? Well, it's pretty simple. You have A B C D E and you have a checkbox next to each one. If you like A and B, check both boxes.  If you like D and E, check those.  If you like every candidate but A, then there you go.  This is approval voting, where you vote for those you approve of.

caption='Vote for as many as you like.' 

comment='simple,lots of candidates, one voter' id='approval_sim' %}

So say there's two populations of people and they like candidates in their little circle. If you allow them to vote for everybody in their circle, then the people in the middle get more votes than the people on either side.

<!--This solved a big problem.  Usually, the way we do things is to only allow one choice.  If you only allow these voters to vote for one person, then they're going to vote for the person in the center of their circle. You can imagine this like a primary. So each group has their own primary.  And each one picks their own candidate, and they run against each other in the general And nobody is running in the middle.   Why? Because people are only going to vote for their own nominees. And even if they do vote for the middle guy,  it's going to be a small amount of people. the rest of the people are closer to one or the other Party candidate.-->

## The World of Voting Methods

There's also other voting methods where you can judge on a scale from 1 to 10 like you do for a diving contest or figure skating.  And you can get very fine-grained with that. That's called score voting, where you get them a score.

comment='simple,lots of candidates, one voter' id='score_sim' %}

Another great voting method combines score voting with counting by pairs.  This is called STAR voting, Score Then Automatic Runoff.  First we score. Then we find the top two and send them to a runoff.  The runoff uses the same scores but counts them by pairs, like we did before.

You could involve some conditionals. Like you could eliminate candidates that aren't doing well. That way they don't interfere with the main candidates.  This method is called RCV and is getting more popular in the US <!--link to RCV-->.

And you can also have a multi-winner system where maybe you have two candidates getting elected<!--link to multiwinner-->.  For example, maybe you're picking a pizza and you can have meat lovers pizza and you can also have a vegetarian pizza. You don't have to all eat the same pizza.

And of course, there's primaries, which is the way we do things now, and can work in the best case scenario, but can also malfunction.

## Afterword

To wrap things up, there's a lot of ways you could deal with voting (casting a ballot), and there's actually even more ways you can count ballots (tallying).  As far as casting a ballot goes, picking one person does not find common ground in a group.  But picking multiple people… that allows you to find common ground.  And that's the point of this explanation. You have to allow people to vote for more than one person in order to find common ground.

Still want more? Try the sandbox below, where I've added a ton more voting methods and configuration options.  

Want more of a narrative?  Then choose your path.  Either read about Primaries and polls, more details about approval voting and strategy based on polling, or an essay by Jameson Quinn on types of strategy with score voting and some resistance to it with STAR voting.  Soon, I'll have an essay about RCV, IRV, STV, and multi-winner methods.  It's a work in progress.
